A real-time gender classifier built on google colab. Dataset was obtained from a public upload on Kaggle.

There are two parts to this project:
* Human face detection
* Gender classification for detected faces

The first part is done using a built-in function from the cv2 library, but the classification part was done without a pre-trained model. Reached a final accuracy of around 95% on the testing dataset.

Shows the classifier running on multiple people at once through a webcam. The detection box tracks all faces on the screen, feeds each of them through the trained model, and returns its output as a label above the box.

This is an example of the model detecting a male and a female face at the same time.
