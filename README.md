A real-time gender classifier built on google colab. Dataset was obtained from a public upload on Kaggle.

There are two parts to this project:
* Human face detection
* Gender classification for detected faces

The first part is done using a built-in function from the cv2 library, but the classification part was done without a pre-trained model. Reached final accuracy of around 95% on testing dataset.
